The extension is applied and configured on a collection.\n\nThis extension listens for changes to the specified collection. If a document is added, updated, or deleted, this\nextension will:\n\n- Add/Update - document will be indexed into Algolia.  The fields defined in the extension configuration will be used to send to Algolia.  The document Id will be used as the object id in Algolia.\n- Delete - the Algolia record associate to document id will be removed.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've\n[set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart)\nin your Firebase project.\n\nYou must also have an Algolia account set up before installing this\nextension. You can do so on the [Algolia][https://www.algolia.com/] site.\n\n#### Billing\n\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the\n[Blaze (pay as you go) plan][blaze-pricing].\n\n- You will be charged [around $0.01 per month][pricing-examples] for each\n  instance of this extension you install.\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services,\n  which have associated charges if you exceed the service's free tier:\n    - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs][faq].)\n    - Cloud Firestore\n\n[blaze-pricing]: https://firebase.google.com/pricing\n[pricing-examples]: https://cloud.google.com/functions/pricing#pricing_examples\n[faq]: https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-24\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents\nThis extension only sends the documents that have been changed -- it does not index existing documents into Algolia. In order to backfill your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index with all the documents in your collection, you can run the import script provided by this extension.\n\nThe import script can read all existing documents in a Cloud Firestore collection and insert them into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\nThe `npm run import` is for use with the official Firebase Extension [**Search with Algolia**](https://github.com/algolia/algolia-firebase-extension).\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n- The import script can take up to _O(collection size)_ time to finish.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe import script uses several values from your installation of the extension:\n- Cloud Functions Location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n- Collection Path: What is the path to the collection that you want to index?\n\n- Fields: What are fields in the document do you want to index?\n\n**NOTE:** This configuration can be left empty if you want to index all the fields in this document.\n\n- Algolia Application ID: What is the Algolia application id that contains the index?\n\n- Algolia API Key: What is the Algolia API key with addObject, deleteObject, listIndexes, deleteIndex, editSettings, and settings permissions.\n\n- Algolia Index Name: What is the Algolia index name that will contain the collection document records.\n\nRun the import script using [`npx` (the Node Package Runner)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) via `npm` (the Node Package Manager).\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n\n- To access the `npm` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n- If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  Set up credentials. The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Clone [algolia-firebase-extension](https://github.com/algolia/algolia-firebase-extension) repo.\n1.  Run the import script via `npx`.\n\n- Execute the following command in the `functions` folder:\n\n  ```\n    LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n    ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n    ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n    ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n    COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n    FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n    npm run import\n  ```\n**NOTE:** If the `FIELDS` param contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command above, please clear it out since this is an invalid value.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n","readmeContent":"# Search with Algolia\n\n**Author**: Algolia (**[https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data with Algolia.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Install this experimental extension\n\n> ⚠️ **Experimental**: This extension is available for testing as an _experimental_ release.

See Cloud Functions under [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) for a detailed explanation.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents\nThis extension only sends the documents that have been changed -- it does not index existing documents into Algolia. In order to backfill your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index with all the documents in your collection, you can run the import script provided by this extension.\n\nThe import script can read all existing documents in a Cloud Firestore collection and insert them into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n- The import script can take up to _O(collection size)_ time to finish.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` param if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n","readmeContent":"# Search with Algolia\n\n**Author**: Algolia (**[https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data with Algolia.\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to index your Cloud Firestore data to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) and keep it synced.\n\nYou can then [configure your relevance](/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/#configuring-relevance) using the [Algolia dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard) or [API clients](/doc/api-client/getting-started/install/javascript/).

See Cloud Functions under [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) for a detailed explanation.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` param if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n","readmeContent":"# Search with Algolia\n\n**Author**: Algolia (**[https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data with Algolia.\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to index your Cloud Firestore data to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) and keep it synced.\n\nYou can then [configure your relevance](/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/#configuring-relevance) using the [Algolia dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard) or [API clients](/doc/api-client/getting-started/install/javascript/).

If you add a [document](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#documents), the extension indexes it as a [record in Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/faq/basics/what-is-a-record/).

[Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nYou will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See Cloud Functions under [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) for a detailed explanation.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` param if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n","readmeContent":"# Search with Algolia\n\n**Author**: Algolia (**[https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data with Algolia.\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to index your Cloud Firestore data to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) and keep it synced.\n\nYou can then [configure your relevance](/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/#configuring-relevance) using the [Algolia dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard) or [API clients](/doc/api-client/getting-started/install/javascript/).

Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` or/and `TRANSFORM_FUNCTION` params if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        PROJECT_ID=${param:PROJECT_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        TRANSFORM_FUNCTION=${param:TRANSFORM_FUNCTION}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n      **NOTE**: In the above multiline command, make sure that the `\\` is at the end of each line, except for the last.\n      **NOTE**: Make sure that there is no space inbetween the specified `FIELDS`.

See Cloud Functions under [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) for a detailed explanation.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` or/and `TRANSFORM_FUNCTION` params if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        PROJECT_ID=${param:PROJECT_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        TRANSFORM_FUNCTION=${param:TRANSFORM_FUNCTION}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n      **NOTE**: In the above multiline command, make sure that the `\\` is at the end of each line, except for the last.\n      **NOTE**: Make sure that there is no space inbetween the specified `FIELDS`.

Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` or/and `TRANSFORM_FUNCTION` params if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        PROJECT_ID=${param:PROJECT_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        TRANSFORM_FUNCTION=${param:TRANSFORM_FUNCTION}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n      **NOTE**: In the above multiline command, make sure that the `\\` is at the end of each line, except for the last.\n      **NOTE**: Make sure that there is no space inbetween the specified `FIELDS`.

If you add a [document](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#documents), the extension indexes it as a [record in Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/faq/basics/what-is-a-record/). The extension only indexes the fields defined in the extension configuration and uses the [document Id](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data#add_a_document) as the Algolia [object Id](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/#using-unique-object-identifiers).\n\nAnytime you update a document, the extension propagates the update to the corresponding Algolia record. If you delete a document, the extension removes the corresponding Algolia record.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've set up:\n- [Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n- [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) account.\n\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Algolia ([pricing information](https://www.algolia.com/pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nYou will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See Cloud Functions under [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) for a detailed explanation.\n\n#### Configuration Parameters\n\nCloud Functions Location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension?\n  You usually want a location close to your database.\n  For help selecting a location, refer to the\n  [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n- Collection Path: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should monitor for changes?\n  For subcollection, the syntax is `parent_collection/{parentId}/target_collection`. (please note, there is not depublication process on subcollections).\n\n- Fields: What document fields should be indexed to provide the best search experience? For more information on which fields to index to Algolia, see the [Algolia documentation on records](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/#algolia-records).\n  This can be a comma separated list or left blank to index all fields.\n  For performance reasons, [record size is limited](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/in-depth/index-and-records-size-and-usage-limitations/#record-size-limits).\n  If you're receiving errors that your records are too large, refer to the [reducing record size documentation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/reducing-object-size/).\n\n- Force Data Sync: Are you facing data inconsistent issues possibly due to race conditions?\n  This setting will make sure the function is using the latest data from Firestore by making another read call before processing and sending to Algolia.\n\n- Algolia Application ID: What is the Algolia Application Id?\n  This is the Algolia application you want to index your data to.\n  You can find your credentials including application ID on your Algolia dashboard,\n  under the [API keys tab](https://www.algolia.com/api-keys).\n\n- Algolia API Key: What is your Algolia API key?\n  We recommend [creating a new API key](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/api-keys/#creating-and-managing-api-keys)\n  with \"addObject\", \"deleteObject\", \"listIndexes\", \"deleteIndex\", \"editSettings\", and \"settings\" permissions.\n  **Do not use the Admin API key**.\n\n- Algolia Index Name: What is the Algolia index name?\n  This is the name of the [Algolia index](https://www.algolia.com/doc/faq/basics/what-is-an-index/)\n  where the records will be persisted.\n  Refer to [naming your index](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/#naming-your-index) for more information.\n\n- Transform Function Name (experimental): What is the Firebase Cloud Function Name?\n  This is the name of the Firestore Cloud Function for transforming the data before transmitting to Algolia for indexing.\n  This function should be deployed to the same Firebase Project and Location as the Firestore/Algolia extension.\n  Refer to [Call functions for your app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable).\n  Below is an example of a Transform function used for my testing:\n  ```javascript\n    import * as functions from \"firebase-functions\";\n\n    const doStuffToData = (payload: any) => {\n      return {\n      ...payload,\n      \"hello\": \"world\",\n      };\n    };\n\n    export const helloWorld = functions.https.onCall((payload) => {\n      const transformedData = doStuffToData(payload);\n      return transformedData;\n    });\n  ```\n  **Note**: The Transform Firebase Function should be set up to unauthenticated users at this time.\n\n#### Cloud Functions\n\n- **executeIndexOperation:** Firestore document-triggered function that creates, updates, or deletes data in Algolia.\n","externalServices":[{"name":"Algolia","pricingUri":"https://algolia.com/pricing"}],"displayName":"Search with Algolia","systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/memory","label":"Function memory","type":"SELECT","description":"How much memory should be allocated to each function?","options":[{"value":"128","label":"128MB"},{"value":"256","label":"256MB"},{"value":"512","label":"512MB"},{"value":"1024","label":"1GB"},{"value":"2048","label":"2GB"},{"value":"4096","label":"4GB"},{"value":"8192","label":"8GB"}],"default":"256","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` or/and `TRANSFORM_FUNCTION` params if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        PROJECT_ID=${param:PROJECT_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        TRANSFORM_FUNCTION=${param:TRANSFORM_FUNCTION}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n      **NOTE**: In the above multiline command, make sure that the `\\` is at the end of each line, except for the last.\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n","readmeContent":"# Search with Algolia\n\n**Author**: Algolia (**[https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data with Algolia.\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to index your Cloud Firestore data to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) and keep it synced.\n\nYou can then [configure your relevance](/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/#configuring-relevance) using the [Algolia dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard) or [API clients](/doc/api-client/getting-started/install/javascript/).

Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` or/and `TRANSFORM_FUNCTION` params if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        PROJECT_ID=${param:PROJECT_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        TRANSFORM_FUNCTION=${param:TRANSFORM_FUNCTION}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n      **NOTE**: In the above multiline command, make sure that the `\\` is at the end of each line, except for the last.\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n","readmeContent":"# Search with Algolia\n\n**Author**: Algolia (**[https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data with Algolia.\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to index your Cloud Firestore data to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) and keep it synced.\n\nYou can then [configure your relevance](/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/#configuring-relevance) using the [Algolia dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard) or [API clients](/doc/api-client/getting-started/install/javascript/).

See Cloud Functions under [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) for a detailed explanation.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` or/and `TRANSFORM_FUNCTION` params if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        PROJECT_ID=${param:PROJECT_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        TRANSFORM_FUNCTION=${param:TRANSFORM_FUNCTION}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n      **NOTE**: In the above multiline command, make sure that the `\\` is at the end of each line, except for the last.\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n","readmeContent":"# Search with Algolia\n\n**Author**: Algolia (**[https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data with Algolia.\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to index your Cloud Firestore data to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) and keep it synced.\n\nYou can then [configure your relevance](/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/#configuring-relevance) using the [Algolia dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard) or [API clients](/doc/api-client/getting-started/install/javascript/).

If you add a [document](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#documents), the extension indexes it as a [record in Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/faq/basics/what-is-a-record/). The extension only indexes the fields defined in the extension configuration and uses the [document Id](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data#add_a_document) as the Algolia [object Id](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/#using-unique-object-identifiers).\n\nAnytime you update a document, the extension propagates the update to the corresponding Algolia record.

Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents\nThis extension only sends the documents that have been changed -- it does not index existing documents into Algolia. In order to backfill your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index with all the documents in your collection, you can run the import script provided by this extension.\n\nThe import script can read all existing documents in a Cloud Firestore collection and insert them into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\nThe `npm run import` is for use with the official Firebase Extension [**Search with Algolia**](https://github.com/algolia/algolia-firebase-extension).\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n- The import script can take up to _O(collection size)_ time to finish.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe import script uses several values from your installation of the extension:\n- Cloud Functions Location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n- Collection Path: What is the path to the collection that you want to index?\n\n- Fields: What are fields in the document do you want to index?\n\n**NOTE:** This configuration can be left empty if you want to index all the fields in this document.\n\n- Algolia Application ID: What is the Algolia application id that contains the index?\n\n- Algolia API Key: What is the Algolia API key with addObject, deleteObject, listIndexes, deleteIndex, editSettings, and settings permissions.\n\n- Algolia Index Name: What is the Algolia index name that will contain the collection document records.\n\nRun the import script using [`npx` (the Node Package Runner)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) via `npm` (the Node Package Manager).\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n\n- To access the `npm` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n- If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  Set up credentials. The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Clone [algolia-firebase-extension](https://github.com/algolia/algolia-firebase-extension) repo.\n1.  Run the import script via `npx`.\n\n- Execute the following command in the `functions` folder:\n\n  ```\n    LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n    ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n    ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n    ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n    COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n    FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n    npm run import\n  ```\n**NOTE:** If the `FIELDS` param contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command above, please clear it out since this is an invalid value.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n","readmeContent":"# Search with Algolia\n\n**Author**: Algolia (**[https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data with Algolia.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Install this experimental extension\n\n> ⚠️ **Experimental**: This extension is available for testing as an _experimental_ release.

See Cloud Functions under [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) for a detailed explanation.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents\nThis extension only sends the documents that have been changed -- it does not index existing documents into Algolia. In order to backfill your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index with all the documents in your collection, you can run the import script provided by this extension.\n\nThe import script can read all existing documents in a Cloud Firestore collection and insert them into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n- The import script can take up to _O(collection size)_ time to finish.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` param if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n","readmeContent":"# Search with Algolia\n\n**Author**: Algolia (**[https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data with Algolia.\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to index your Cloud Firestore data to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) and keep it synced.\n\nYou can then [configure your relevance](/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/#configuring-relevance) using the [Algolia dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard) or [API clients](/doc/api-client/getting-started/install/javascript/).

See Cloud Functions under [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) for a detailed explanation.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` param if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n","readmeContent":"# Search with Algolia\n\n**Author**: Algolia (**[https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data with Algolia.\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to index your Cloud Firestore data to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) and keep it synced.\n\nYou can then [configure your relevance](/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/#configuring-relevance) using the [Algolia dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard) or [API clients](/doc/api-client/getting-started/install/javascript/).

See Cloud Functions under [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) for a detailed explanation.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` param if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n","readmeContent":"# Search with Algolia\n\n**Author**: Algolia (**[https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data with Algolia.\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to index your Cloud Firestore data to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) and keep it synced.\n\nYou can then [configure your relevance](/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/#configuring-relevance) using the [Algolia dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard) or [API clients](/doc/api-client/getting-started/install/javascript/).

Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` or/and `TRANSFORM_FUNCTION` params if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        TRANSFORM_FUNCTION=${param:TRANSFORM_FUNCTION}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n      **NOTE**: In the above multiline command, make sure that the `\\` is at the end of each line, except for the last.\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n","readmeContent":"# Search with Algolia\n\n**Author**: Algolia (**[https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data with Algolia.\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to index your Cloud Firestore data to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) and keep it synced.\n\nYou can then [configure your relevance](/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/#configuring-relevance) using the [Algolia dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard) or [API clients](/doc/api-client/getting-started/install/javascript/).

If you delete a document, the extension removes the corresponding Algolia record.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've set up:\n- [Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n- [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) account.\n\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Algolia ([pricing information](https://www.algolia.com/pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nYou will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See Cloud Functions under [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) for a detailed explanation.\n\n#### Configuration Parameters\n\nCloud Functions Location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension?\n  You usually want a location close to your database.\n  For help selecting a location, refer to the\n  [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n- Collection Path: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should monitor for changes?\n  For subcollection, the syntax is `parent_collection/{parentId}/target_collection`.

Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` or/and `TRANSFORM_FUNCTION` params if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        PROJECT_ID=${param:PROJECT_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        TRANSFORM_FUNCTION=${param:TRANSFORM_FUNCTION}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n      **NOTE**: In the above multiline command, make sure that the `\\` is at the end of each line, except for the last.\n      **NOTE**: Make sure that there is no space inbetween the specified `FIELDS`.

Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` or/and `TRANSFORM_FUNCTION` params if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        PROJECT_ID=${param:PROJECT_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        TRANSFORM_FUNCTION=${param:TRANSFORM_FUNCTION}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n      **NOTE**: In the above multiline command, make sure that the `\\` is at the end of each line, except for the last.\n      **NOTE**: Make sure that there is no space inbetween the specified `FIELDS`.

Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` or/and `TRANSFORM_FUNCTION` params if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n      npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n      Below are the questions that will be asked:\n      ```\n      What is the Region? ${param:LOCATION}\n      What is the Project Id? ${param:PROJECT_ID}\n      What is the Algolia App Id? ${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\n      What is the Algolia Api Key? ${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\n      What is the Algolia Index Name? ${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\n      What is the Collection Path? ${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\n      What are the Fields to extract? ${param:FIELDS}\n      What is the Transform Function? ${param:TRANSFORM_FUNCTION}\n      What is the path to the Google Application Credential File? </path/to/service/account/key>\n      ```\n      **NOTE**: Make sure that there is no space inbetween the specified `FIELDS`.

See Cloud Functions under [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) for a detailed explanation.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` or/and `TRANSFORM_FUNCTION` params if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n      npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n      Below are the questions that will be asked:\n      ```\n      What is the Region? ${param:LOCATION}\n      What is the Project Id? ${param:PROJECT_ID}\n      What is the Algolia App Id? ${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\n      What is the Algolia Api Key? ${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\n      What is the Algolia Index Name? ${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\n      What is the Collection Path? ${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\n      What are the Fields to extract? ${param:FIELDS}\n      What is the Transform Function? ${param:TRANSFORM_FUNCTION}\n      What is the path to the Google Application Credential File? </path/to/service/account/key>\n      ```\n      **NOTE**: Make sure that there is no space inbetween the specified `FIELDS`.

The extension is applied and configured on a Firestore [collection](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#collections) or [subcollection](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#subcollections).\n\nThis extension listens for changes on the specified collection. If you add a [document](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#documents), the extension indexes it as a [record in Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/faq/basics/what-is-a-record/). The extension only indexes the fields defined in the extension configuration and uses the [document Id](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data#add_a_document) as the Algolia [object Id](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/#using-unique-object-identifiers).\n\nAnytime you update a document, the extension propagates the update to the corresponding Algolia record. If you delete a document, the extension removes the corresponding Algolia record.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've set up:\n- [Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n- [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) account.\n\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Algolia ([pricing information](https://www.algolia.com/pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nYou will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See Cloud Functions under [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) for a detailed explanation.\n\n#### Configuration Parameters\n\nCloud Functions Location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension?\n  You usually want a location close to your database.\n  For help selecting a location, refer to the\n  [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n- Collection Path: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should monitor for changes?\n  For subcollection, the syntax is `parent_collection/{parentId}/target_collection`. (please note, there is not depublication process on subcollections).\n\n- Fields: What document fields should be indexed to provide the best search experience? For more information on which fields to index to Algolia, see the [Algolia documentation on records](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/#algolia-records).\n  This can be a comma separated list or left blank to index all fields.\n  For performance reasons, [record size is limited](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/in-depth/index-and-records-size-and-usage-limitations/#record-size-limits).\n  If you're receiving errors that your records are too large, refer to the [reducing record size documentation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/reducing-object-size/).\n\n- Algolia Application ID: What is the Algolia Application Id?\n  This is the Algolia application you want to index your data to.\n  You can find your credentials including application ID on your Algolia dashboard,\n  under the [API keys tab](https://www.algolia.com/api-keys).\n\n- Algolia API Key: What is your Algolia API key?\n  We recommend [creating a new API key](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/api-keys/#creating-and-managing-api-keys)\n  with \"addObject\", \"deleteObject\", \"listIndexes\", \"deleteIndex\", \"editSettings\", and \"settings\" permissions.\n  **Do not use the Admin API key**.\n\n- Algolia Index Name: What is the Algolia index name?\n  This is the name of the [Algolia index](https://www.algolia.com/doc/faq/basics/what-is-an-index/)\n  where the records will be persisted.\n  Refer to [naming your index](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/#naming-your-index) for more information.\n\n- Transform Function Name (experimental): What is the Firebase Cloud Function Name?\n  This is the name of the Firestore Cloud Function for transforming the data before transmitting to Algolia for indexing.\n  This function should be deployed to the same Firebase Project and Location as the Firestore/Algolia extension.\n  Refer to [Call functions for your app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable).\n  Below is an example of a Transform function used for my testing:\n  ```javascript\n    import * as functions from \"firebase-functions\";\n\n    const doStuffToData = (payload: any) => {\n      return {\n      ...payload,\n      \"hello\": \"world\",\n      };\n    };\n\n    export const helloWorld = functions.https.onCall((payload) => {\n      const transformedData = doStuffToData(payload);\n      return transformedData;\n    });\n  ```\n  **Note**: The Transform Firebase Function should be set up to unauthenticated users at this time.\n\n#### Cloud Functions\n\n- **executeIndexOperation:** Firestore document-triggered function that creates, updates, or deletes data in Algolia.\n","externalServices":[{"name":"Algolia","pricingUri":"https://algolia.com/pricing"}],"displayName":"Search with Algolia","systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/memory","label":"Function memory","type":"SELECT","description":"How much memory should be allocated to each function?","options":[{"value":"128","label":"128MB"},{"value":"256","label":"256MB"},{"value":"512","label":"512MB"},{"value":"1024","label":"1GB"},{"value":"2048","label":"2GB"},{"value":"4096","label":"4GB"},{"value":"8192","label":"8GB"}],"default":"256","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` or/and `TRANSFORM_FUNCTION` params if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        PROJECT_ID=${param:PROJECT_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        TRANSFORM_FUNCTION=${param:TRANSFORM_FUNCTION}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n      **NOTE**: In the above multiline command, make sure that the `\\` is at the end of each line, except for the last.\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n","readmeContent":"# Search with Algolia\n\n**Author**: Algolia (**[https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data with Algolia.\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to index your Cloud Firestore data to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) and keep it synced.\n\nYou can then [configure your relevance](/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/#configuring-relevance) using the [Algolia dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard) or [API clients](/doc/api-client/getting-started/install/javascript/).

See Cloud Functions under [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) for a detailed explanation.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` or/and `TRANSFORM_FUNCTION` params if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        PROJECT_ID=${param:PROJECT_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        TRANSFORM_FUNCTION=${param:TRANSFORM_FUNCTION}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n      **NOTE**: In the above multiline command, make sure that the `\\` is at the end of each line, except for the last.\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n","readmeContent":"# Search with Algolia\n\n**Author**: Algolia (**[https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data with Algolia.\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to index your Cloud Firestore data to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) and keep it synced.\n\nYou can then [configure your relevance](/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/#configuring-relevance) using the [Algolia dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard) or [API clients](/doc/api-client/getting-started/install/javascript/).

If you add a [document](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#documents), the extension indexes it as a [record in Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/faq/basics/what-is-a-record/). The extension only indexes the fields defined in the extension configuration and uses the [document Id](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data#add_a_document) as the Algolia [object Id](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/#using-unique-object-identifiers).\n\nAnytime you update a document, the extension propagates the update to the corresponding Algolia record.

[Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nYou will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See Cloud Functions under [Firebase Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) for a detailed explanation.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to the [Cloud Firestore tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't exist already, create a collection called `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`.\n\n1.  Create, update, or delete a document in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection.  Go to Algolia's dashboard and verify in Algolia that a record is created, updated, or deleted in the `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index for application id `${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}`.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nThis extension listens to the Cloud Firestore collection `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}`. If you create, update, or delete a document within that collection, this extension will:\n\n- Indexes the document and send all the fields or configured fields defined in the extension.\n- or, removes the record from Algolia index if the document is deleted.\n\n### _(Optional)_ Import existing documents or Reindex after configuration changes\nThis extension starts monitoring the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection after a successful installation. Any existing documents created before the extension installation can be back-filled into your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` Index using the import script.  Also, you will need to run the import script if you change the Indexable Fields, Index Name, Application Id, and/or API Key configuration.\n\nThe import script will read all existing documents in the `${param:COLLECTION_PATH}` collection and insert them into the Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n\n##### Important notes\n\n- You must run the import script over the entire collection **_after_** installing the Search with Algolia extension; otherwise you will have missing records in your Algolia `${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}` index.\n- `lastmodified` attributed is added to all Algolia records to eliminate race condition issues related from the Cloud Function cold start.\n\n#### Run the script\n\nThe script will use the extension configuration before the import process starts.\n\nRun the import process using `npx`.\n\n1.  Make sure that you've installed the required tools to run the import script:\n    - To access the `npx` command tools, you need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/).\n    - If you use `npm` v5.1 or earlier, you need to explicitly install `npx`. Run `npm install --global npx`.\n\n1.  The import script uses Application Default Credentials to communicate with Firebase.\n    Please follow the instructions to [generate a key for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).\n\n1.  Execute the below command:\n    - Update the path to the Google Application credentials.\n    - Clear out the `FIELDS` or/and `TRANSFORM_FUNCTION` params if it contains `{ unspecified parameter }` in the command below since it's an invalid value.\n      ```\n        LOCATION=${param:LOCATION}\\\n        PROJECT_ID=${param:PROJECT_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_APP_ID=${param:ALGOLIA_APP_ID}\\\n        ALGOLIA_API_KEY=${param:ALGOLIA_API_KEY}\\\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=${param:ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME}\\\n        COLLECTION_PATH=${param:COLLECTION_PATH}\\\n        FIELDS=${param:FIELDS}\\\n        TRANSFORM_FUNCTION=${param:TRANSFORM_FUNCTION}\\\n        GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=</path/to/service/account/key>\\\n        npx firestore-algolia-search\n      ```\n      **NOTE**: In the above multiline command, make sure that the `\\` is at the end of each line, except for the last.\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n","readmeContent":"# Search with Algolia\n\n**Author**: Algolia (**[https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Enable full text search of your Cloud Firestore data with Algolia.\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to index your Cloud Firestore data to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) and keep it synced.\n\nYou can then [configure your relevance](/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/#configuring-relevance) using the [Algolia dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/dashboard) or [API clients](/doc/api-client/getting-started/install/javascript/).

The extension is applied and configured on a Firestore [collection](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#collections) or [subcollection](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#subcollections).\n\nThis extension listens for changes on the specified collection. If you add a [document](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#documents), the extension indexes it as a [record in Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/faq/basics/what-is-a-record/). The extension only indexes the fields defined in the extension configuration and uses the [document Id](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data#add_a_document) as the Algolia [object Id](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/#using-unique-object-identifiers).\n\nAnytime you update a document, the extension propagates the update to the corresponding Algolia record. If you delete a document, the extension removes the corresponding Algolia record.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've set up:\n- [Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n- [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) account.\n\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Algolia ([pricing information](https://www.algolia.com/pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nYou will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension.

For more information on which fields to index to Algolia, see the [Algolia documentation on records](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/#algolia-records).\n  This can be a comma separated list or left blank to index all fields.\n  For performance reasons, [record size is limited](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/in-depth/index-and-records-size-and-usage-limitations/#record-size-limits).\n  If you're receiving errors that your records are too large, refer to the [reducing record size documentation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/reducing-object-size/).\n\n- Force Data Sync: Are you facing data inconsistent issues possibly due to race conditions?\n  This setting will make sure the function is using the latest data from Firestore by making another read call before processing and sending to Algolia.\n\n- Algolia Application ID: What is the Algolia Application Id?\n  This is the Algolia application you want to index your data to.\n  You can find your credentials including application ID on your Algolia dashboard,\n  under the [API keys tab](https://www.algolia.com/api-keys).\n\n- Algolia API Key: What is your Algolia API key?\n  We recommend [creating a new API key](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/api-keys/#creating-and-managing-api-keys)\n  with \"addObject\", \"deleteObject\", \"listIndexes\", \"deleteIndex\", \"editSettings\", and \"settings\" permissions.\n  **Do not use the Admin API key**.\n\n- Algolia Index Name: What is the Algolia index name?\n  This is the name of the [Algolia index](https://www.algolia.com/doc/faq/basics/what-is-an-index/)\n  where the records will be persisted.\n  Refer to [naming your index](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/send-and-update-your-data/#naming-your-index) for more information.\n\n- Transform Function Name (experimental): What is the Firebase Cloud Function Name?\n  This is the name of the Firestore Cloud Function for transforming the data before transmitting to Algolia for indexing.\n  This function should be deployed to the same Firebase Project and Location as the Firestore/Algolia extension.\n  Refer to [Call functions for your app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable).\n  Below is an example of a Transform function used for my testing:\n  ```javascript\n    import * as functions from \"firebase-functions\";\n\n    const doStuffToData = (payload: any) => {\n      return {\n      ...payload,\n      \"hello\": \"world\",\n      };\n    };\n\n    export const helloWorld = functions.https.onCall((payload) => {\n      const transformedData = doStuffToData(payload);\n      return transformedData;\n    });\n  ```\n  **Note**: The Transform Firebase Function should be set up to unauthenticated users at this time.\n\n#### Cloud Functions\n\n- **executeIndexOperation:** Firestore document-triggered function that creates, updates, or deletes data in Algolia.\n","externalServices":[{"name":"Algolia","pricingUri":"https://algolia.com/pricing"}],"lifecycleEvents":[{"stage":"ON_INSTALL","processingMessage":"Indexing existing documents in ${COLLECTION_PATH}","taskQueueTriggerFunction":"executeFullIndexOperation"},{"stage":"ON_UPDATE","processingMessage":"Indexing existing documents in ${COLLECTION_PATH}","taskQueueTriggerFunction":"executeFullIndexOperation"},{"stage":"ON_CONFIGURE","processingMessage":"Indexing existing documents in ${COLLECTION_PATH}","taskQueueTriggerFunction":"executeFullIndexOperation"}],"displayName":"Search Firestore with Algolia","systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/memory","label":"Function memory","type":"SELECT","description":"How much memory should be allocated to each function?","options":[{"value":"128","label":"128MB"},{"value":"256","label":"256MB"},{"value":"512","label":"512MB"},{"value":"1024","label":"1GB"},{"value":"2048","label":"2GB"},{"value":"4096","label":"4GB"},{"value":"8192","label":"8GB"}],"default":"256","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.
